My skills include business analytics, data visualization, and storytelling, Tableau, SQL, and ML. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills to drive growth and boost sales in the health and communication sectors.

Currently, I am a personal trainer and health coach in search for my first position as a business analyst. My previous experience working in the fitness industry has helped me develop my communication, analytical, time management, and problem-solving skills. Along with an understanding for business trends within the health and fitness sector. In the spring of 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen 4-month Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered data collection and interpretation (Microsoft, Google), data visualization (tableau), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects. You can learn more about this in my portfolio repository!

Some facts about me:

I enjoy being physically active and helping inspire others to live a healthy lifestyle!

I love yoga, and am a certified yoga instructor

I am passionate about nature, travel, and photography. 

My goals for 2024: landing my first job in data. And sign with a modeling agency.
